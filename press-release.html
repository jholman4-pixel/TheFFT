      <h1>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h1>
      <h2>Florida’s New Era of Football: Introducing The Florida Football Team</h2>
      <p class="small"><strong>Miami, FL — August 31, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>Florida is entering a bold new chapter in its sports history with the official launch of <strong>The Florida Football Team</strong>, a grassroots-driven organization built by and for the people of the Sunshine State.</p>

      <p>The rebrand reflects a move away from a temporary identity and toward a lasting, unifying symbol for fans across Florida. By choosing a name that highlights the state itself, the team emphasizes pride, resilience, and the passion that defines Florida communities.</p>

      <blockquote>“Florida deserves a team that represents every corner of our state, from the Panhandle to the Keys,” said <em>[Team President/Owner Name]</em>. “The Florida Football Team isn’t just about the game—it’s about community, energy, and building a tradition that every Floridian can stand behind.”</blockquote>

      <p>The new logo features a bold shield design with Florida-inspired colors—deep navy blue and bright orange—that symbolize strength, energy, and the state’s sunsets. At the heart of the brand is its larger-than-life mascot: <strong>Florida Man</strong>. Depicted as a fearless, determined figure standing strong against hurricane winds and raising a flag, Florida Man represents the humor, grit, and resilience of the state’s spirit.</p>

      <p>Fans can expect a series of community-driven events, merchandise drops, and interactive fan experiences leading up to the inaugural season. From grassroots programs supporting youth athletes to statewide celebrations, The Florida Football Team is committed to building a lasting tradition that unites Florida’s football fans under one banner.</p>
